**A Machine Learning approach for ACMG/AMP-based Genomic Variant Classification and Prioritization** by G. Nicora, S. Zucca, I. Limongelli, P. Magni and R. Bellazzi.

### AIM
Classification and prioritization of genomic variants associated with inherited disorders. 

### Background: 
inherited variants are nowadays interpreted according to the ACMG/AMP guidelines [1], which define 5 different tiers of classification: *Pathogenic, Likely pathogenic, Benign, Likely benign, VUS (variant of uncertain significance)*. Therefore, when evidence is not enough for classification, a variant can be still uncertain (VUS). To interpret VUS variants, data-driven approaches, such as Machine Learning algorithms, can be used. 

### Methods
Variants are annotated and interpreted according to the ACMG/AMP guidelines [1] by the eVai software [2]. ACMG/AMP levels of evidence are used as features for Machine learning approaches (in particular, Logistic Regression). 

### Results
We applied our framework on different datasets. Results are shown in the Notebook.
